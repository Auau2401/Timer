# Timer

We introduce our two timers! Programmed with love <3

# Development

The timer are developed in pure HTML, CSS and JS. 

# Usage

On https://reactorx.de set your end time. And select between two of the options. You will get a preview. (NOTE: The timers look the best in an iframe, because we coded it without a lot of CSS)

Feel free to edit the timers and use it.

We reccomend using the IFrame on our Website. But you can also clone this repository. (No packages required)

# Generating

Most of the codes in codes.json are generated by a python script, which we made. But it's too sloppy to publish it ;)
